Blink of an Eye is a very quick and extremely short story. It is a first-person short story where it gives an exaggerated speed, but relatable feel, to how quick time goes by. You can do completely nothing all day, and by the time you notice it, the day will be over once more. Time gone and wasted in the blink of an eye. That is what Y/N (your name) goes through.

I made this because when I started realising how finals, for this fall semester, were soon approaching, I realised how fast time went. Besides the fact that there is a pandemic, I felt like I had no life these few months. I've been so focused on my studies that I didn't realise how I easily forgot about everything around me in order to get as much work done as I possibly could. I made this short story as a sense of saying, "Do something." The days don't last as long as the use to and we need to take advantage of every day given to us..
